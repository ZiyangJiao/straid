# StRAID
This repository is the code of our paper "StRAID: Stripe-threaded Architecture for Parity-based RAIDs with Ultra-fast SSDs".

This repository only exposes part of the test scripts and related codes, mainly including motivation tests on Linux MD RAID and core benchmark tests of StRAID.

# MD Bottleneck analysis
Check scripts/bottleneck_analysis.md for more informations about how to install and perf Linux parity-based RAIDs (i.e., MD RAID-4/5/6) and analyze its bottleneck under multi-threads.

# StRAID test
See code/README.md for more informations about how to test StRAID.
